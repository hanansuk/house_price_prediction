## House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques (Ames, Iowa Housing Dataset)

### By Joy Moglia, Irene Shaffer, Hanan Sukenik

In this project, I will be using a dataset from Kaggle which contains daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations, ranging from 2007 to 2017.
After some data exploration, data wrangling and manipulation, I will be implementing several different machine learning algorithms to try and predict whether it will rain the next day or not.



Through this project, I will:

- Explore the data
- Perform the needed data wrangling and manipulation
- Model and visualize the data
- Implement different ML algorithms and examine their results

The project includes several files:

- Chanan Sukenik COMPSCIX433.6- Final Project.ipynb - A Jupyter Notebook containing all of the code (Python)
- Chanan Sukenik COMPSCIX433.6- Final Project.pdf - The written report
- weatherAUS.csv- The dataset

General Notes:
- Weather is hard to predict, but I believe we got some solid results here
- TLDR: Random Forest & Logistic Regression win

Enjoy!
